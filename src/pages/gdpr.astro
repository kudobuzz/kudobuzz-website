      <p>
        Kudobuzz is committed to protecting the privacy and data rights of our customers and their end-users in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679. This document outlines Kudobuzz’s role, responsibilities, and commitments under GDPR, as well as the responsibilities of our customers when using Kudobuzz services.
      </p>
    </Fragment>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>
        This statement applies to all Kudobuzz services, including apps, integrations, and features offered through supported platforms.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Data Controller vs Data Processor</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Customers (Merchants) act as the Data Controller. They determine the purposes and means of processing personal data collected through Kudobuzz.</li>
        <li>Kudobuzz acts as the Data Processor, processing data strictly on the instructions of our customers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">
        Note: Kudobuzz does not determine the purpose of data collection for merchants’ customers. Therefore, ultimate responsibility for GDPR compliance in how data is collected and used rests with the merchant.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Data Processing Activities</h2>
      <p>Kudobuzz processes data solely to provide its services, which may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Collecting, storing, and displaying customer reviews.</li>
        <li>Syncing and displaying user-generated content from social media platforms.</li>
        <li>Providing analytics and reports to merchants.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not use or sell personal data for advertising purposes.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
      <p>Our legal basis for processing personal data is derived from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The necessity of processing to perform the Kudobuzz service.</li>
        <li>The consent obtained by merchants from their end-users.</li>
        <li>Legitimate interests, where applicable, such as fraud prevention and product security.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Data Subject Rights</h2>
      <p>Under GDPR, individuals have rights including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access to their data.</li>
        <li>Rectification of inaccurate data.</li>
        <li>Erasure (“right to be forgotten”).</li>
        <li>Restriction or objection to processing.</li>
        <li>Data portability.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Kudobuzz will reasonably assist merchants in fulfilling these requests, but it is the merchant’s responsibility to respond to their customers’ GDPR requests in a timely manner.
      </p>

    <section class="legal-section">

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>Breach Notification</h2>
