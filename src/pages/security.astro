     <Fragment slot="intro">
      <p>
         At Kudobuzz, safeguarding the data of our merchants and their customers is a top priority. This policy outlines our approach to data security, including the technical, organizational, and procedural measures we implement to protect data.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        While Kudobuzz takes extensive steps to secure its platform, merchants also share responsibility for ensuring their own systems and practices align with security best practices.
