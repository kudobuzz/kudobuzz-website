      <p>
        This Cookie Policy explains how Kudobuzz uses cookies and similar tracking technologies on
        our websites and apps. We use these technologies to understand how you use our services,
        improve your experience, and deliver relevant content.

      <h2>1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small text files stored on your device when you visit a website. They allow us to
        recognise your browser, remember preferences, and measure engagement. We use both session
        cookies (which expire when you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which remain until
        deleted).
      </p>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>2. Types Of Cookies We Use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Essential cookies</strong> enable core functionality like account authentication,
          security protections, and shopping cart features.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Analytics cookies</strong> help us understand product usage, diagnose issues, and
          make improvements. We typically use privacy-focused analytics tools with aggregated
          reporting.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Functional cookies</strong> remember your preferences such as language, storefront,
          or layout settings so you don’t have to set them each visit.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Advertising cookies</strong> (used sparingly) enable us to deliver and measure
          promotional campaigns in a privacy-respecting way.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>3. Third-Party Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        Some analytics and marketing partners may set their own cookies. These third parties process
        data according to their privacy policies. We work only with vendors who adhere to recognised
        privacy standards and provide ways to opt out.

      <h2>4. Your Choices</h2>
      <p>
        You can control cookies through your browser settings, by clearing cookies or by using
        browser add-ons that block tracking. Certain features of Kudobuzz may not function properly
        without essential cookies. When required, we will present a cookie banner so you can manage
        optional cookie categories directly on our site.

      <h2>5. Updates</h2>

        We may update this Cookie Policy to reflect changes in technology, law, or our use of
        cookies. Please review this page regularly for the latest information.
